<b><a name="coursedescription">Course Description</a></b><hr>
<p>MIT STUDIO teaches modern tools and methods for product design and development. Teams consisting of MIT Sloan MBA students, MIT Engineering students, and undergraduate RISD Industrial Design students conceive, design, and prototype a physical product over the course of the semester. An <a href="http://web.mit.edu/15.783j/www/gallery.html" target="_blank">"alpha prototype"</a> is presented by each team at the end of the course.
<br>
<br>Project ideas come from the students in the class and are rated (by students) for potential. The most promising opportunities (rated by student interest) will be used to form project teams for the remainder of the semester. <b>Each team will be allocated a $1000 budget for product development.</b> The course is generously supported by a small number of sponsors, who may also suggest one or more project opportunities for your consideration. 
<br>
<br>The class is primarily intended for seniors in Industrial Design, and is jointly taught by <a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Jerome-Arul/" target="_blank">RISD Prof. Jerome Arul</a> and MIT faculty Prof. Steven Eppinger and Prof. Maria Yang. The first half of each class session will generally be in lecture and discussion format, and the second half will be used for project team meetings and consultation with faculty. Lectures are held on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons at MIT Sloan in Cambridge MA.   
<br>
<br>At MIT, this course goes by the name "Product Design and Development".</p>

<br>
<b><a name="travel">Travel to Cambridge MA</a></b><hr>
<p>During the semester, RISD Students will need to travel to/from <b>MIT</b> in <b>Cambridge MA</b> twice a week.
<br>Students will need to budget and plan accordingly for travel in their schedule. 
<br>
<br><b>MBTA Commuter Rail</b>
<br>The commuter rail travels regularly from Providence Station to <b>South Station</b> in Boston (<a href="https://www.mbta.com/schedules/CR-Providence/timetable" target="_blank">train schedule</a>).
<br>You will then take the Red Line T to <b>Kendall Station</b> in Cambridge.
<br>You should allow for upto 2 hours of travel time each way.
<br>Approx. cost of travel: $25 per day per student
<br>Some MBTA discounts are available to students.
<!-- correct as of 2017: adding up to $600 for the semester per student. -->
<br>
<br><b>RISD Van</b>
<br>RISD Facilities rents out a Van for students to use. 
<br>Approx. cost of travel: $11 per day per student (full van)
<br>This will be a lab fee, charged to your tuition account.
<br>You need at least 12 students per van, with 2-3 of them as licensed drivers.    
<br>The drivers need to complete a quick test with Facilities, and pick-up/drop-off the van for each trip. 
<br>The van will get free parking at MIT. 
<br>You should allow for upto 2 hours of travel time each way (traffic).
<br>Students will need to coordinate amongst themselves and Maureen for the van option to work.
<br>This is the most affordable option.
<!-- correct as of 2017: really $10.50 adding up to $250 for the semester per student. -->
<br>
<br><b>Carpool</b>
<br>You can also carpool with your peers/colleagues, and split the cost of travel. 
<br>Parking in Cambridge can cost upto $30.</p>
<br>
