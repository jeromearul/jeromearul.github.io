<p>MIT STUDIO teaches modern tools and methods for product design and development. Teams consisting of MIT Sloan MBA students, MIT Engineering students, and undergraduate RISD Industrial Design students conceive, design, and prototype a physical product over the course of the semester. An "alpha prototype" is presented by each team at the end of the course.

Project ideas come from the students in the class and are rated (by students) for potential. The most promising opportunities (rated by student interest) will be used to form project teams for the remainder of the semester. Each team will be allocated a budget for product development. The course is generously supported by a small number of sponsors, who may suggest one or more project opportunities for your consideration. 

The class is primarily intended for seniors in Industrial Design, and is jointly taught by MIT faculty. The first half of each class session will generally be in lecture and discussion format, and the second half will be used for project team meetings and consultation with faculty. Lectures are held on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons at MIT Sloan in Cambridge MA.   

At MIT, this course goes by the name "Product Design and Development".</p>
