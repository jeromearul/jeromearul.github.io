<b>Course Description</b><hr>
This class teaches modern tools and methods for product design and development. The cornerstone is a project in which teams of management, engineering, and industrial design students conceive, design, and prototype a physical product. The class is primarily intended for Sloan MBA students (particularly the Entrepreneurship and Innovation track and the Leaders for Global Operations program) and for MIT engineering graduate students (particularly mechanical engineering, manufacturing, and engineering systems masters programs). The course is jointly taught with the Rhode Island School of Design for RISD industrial design students as an advanced studio.
