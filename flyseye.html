		<p class="secondary">fly's eye dome</p>
        <p>Buckminster Fuller made only one prototype of his 24ft fly's eye dome. The dome was recovered from a barn and underwent restoration. I was fortunate enough to participate in it's reassembly in 2011. The original components were subsequently scanned, turned into a parametric model, and duplicated into a fibreglass composite. The dome was featured at Art Basel/Design Miami.</p>
